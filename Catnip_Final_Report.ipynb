    "We used three datasets â€” **police arrest data** , **311 call data** , and **Allegheny County assets data** â€”to evaluate neighborhood quality across Pittsburgh. These datasets capture three *key components* of what we define as the \"best\" neighborhoods: **safety** , **low complaint volume** , and  **access to public assets that support community well-being** . Each submetric is scored on a **100-point scale**, and the final score for each neighborhood is calculated as the **average** of the three submetrics."

    "The Pittsburgh Police Arrest Data provides detailed information on individuals taken into custody by City of Pittsburgh police officers. It includes data such as age, gender, race, arrest time and location, offenses, and neighborhood-level incident details. The dataset covers arrests from March 11, 1998, to November 14, 2023, after which it ceased updating due to a transition to a new records management system. â€‹\n",
    "### *2.2 Why did we choose the police arrest data?*\n",
    "We selected the police arrest data because it offers a direct measure of public safety within neighborhoods. Arrest records, especially for serious offenses, reflect areas where law enforcement activity is concentrated, indicating potential safety concerns. Analyzing this data helps identify patterns and trends in criminal activity, which are crucial for assessing neighborhood safety.â€‹\n",

    "### *2.3 How does it contribute to the final score?*\n",
    "In our neighborhood evaluation metric, the police arrest data serves as the \"safety\" submetric. We calculate a score based on the frequency and severity of arrests in each neighborhood, normalized on a 100-point scale. This safety score is then averaged with scores from other submetricsâ€”such as 311 call data and public assets dataâ€”to derive the final overall score for each neighborhood.\n",

    "The Pittsburgh 311 Data comprises service requests submitted by residents to the City's 311 Response Center. These requests, collected via phone calls, emails, tweets, the city website, and a mobile application, encompass a range of non-emergency issues such as potholes, graffiti, and streetlight outages. Each entry includes details like request type, submission method, status, assigned department, and neighborhood location. The dataset covers requests from April 20, 2015, to February 4, 2025, after which updates ceased due to a system transition.\n",

    "We selected the 311 data because it offers direct insight into residents' concerns and the responsiveness of city services. A higher volume of 311 requests in a neighborhood may indicate underlying issues affecting quality of life or a more engaged community actively reporting problems. Analyzing this data helps identify areas where public services may need improvement or where community engagement is particularly strong.\n",

    "In our evaluation, the 311 data serves as the \"community concern\" submetric.

Notably, New Homestead also scored high in this analysis â€” consistent with its strong performance in the police arrest dataset â€” reinforcing the reliability and alignment of our results. We used the same method as in the police arrest metric, applying the formula score = ((2982âˆ’request_count)/2982)Ã—100 to emphasize differences across neighborhoods and capture the relative scale of reported issues."
