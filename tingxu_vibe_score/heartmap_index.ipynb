    "\n",
    "### Winner\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can see the best place is `Central Business District`, which is `Downtown` in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Central Business District (CBD / Downtown)\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's the core area of ​​Pittsburgh, integrating business, culture, art and transportation.\n",
    "- It's featured by high-density restaurants, cafes, theaters, art galleries, libraries, parks and squares are staggered, pedestrian-friendly, and public transportation is convenient\n",
    "- It's also full of urban rhythm and cultural tension. It is the first choice for exploring the city, experiencing life, and inspiring creative inspiration\n",
    "- `Central Business District` has great urban charm and cultural depth. It is a \"full-dimensional full-score player\" and deserves to be ranked first in my scoring model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loser\n",
    "- `Summer Hill` and `St. Clair` got the lowest score. However, they are not bad places to live in.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summer Hill\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's a quiet, green northern residential community\n",
    "- Mainly single-family homes from the mid-20th century, with a strong family atmosphere and a clean environment\n",
    "- Weaknesses: Lack of commercial, cultural, and entertainment facilities. There are almost no restaurants, cafes, libraries, and parks, and the nightlife and art atmosphere are extremely weak.\n",
    "- In summary, this is an area suitable for families who value tranquility and drive to work. But it is almost unattractive to people who love urban vitality and artistic life\n",
    "\n",
    "#### St. Clair\n",
    "\n",
    "- A southern fringe community with a long history but scarce resources\n",
    "- Once a large public housing area, it is now mostly low-density residential, and the urban farm reconstruction plan (Hilltop Urban Farm) is being promoted\n",
    "- Weaknesses: Serious lack of urban functions, almost no catering, art, education and entertainment facilities; inconvenient transportation and lagging development\n",
    "- It is still in a period of transition, with extremely low living convenience, and lacks appeal to most residents and tourists."

    "We wanted to know:  \n",
    "**Have the ones who are truly alive found warmth somewhere in the city?**  \n",

    "That’s why we focused on libraries, coffee shops, art galleries, grocery stores, and intimate public spaces —  \n",

    "Not about maintenance, but **about meaning**.  \n",

    "we’ll simply say:  \n",
    "**That’s because you’ve never seen sunlight through a wine glass.**  \n",
